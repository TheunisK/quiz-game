# Quiz-Game App

This was my final solo project during my participation in the Boolean UK Full-Stack Engineering course.

It is an app where you can play a quiz in a category of your choice against the clock. I plan to turn it into a daily quiz where you have one attempt per day to achieve the highest streak possible for the game in a fixed amount of time.

It is currently only running as a front end application, but when I'm finished there will be log in functionality where you can view a personal leaderboard of the days you performed your best!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
